  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey all! My name is Jenn Hoskinson and this is me!
    I'm born and raised in Washington State! I've been married for 21 yrs to my high school sweetheart (although he had already graduated). We have 4 kiddos ranging in age from 12-20, 10 animals, and a partrige in a pear tree. LOL I grew up in a very large family so for me, the more the merrier! </p>
    
    <p>I started my career journey in childcare, and then moved on to healthcare, but with special needs kiddos, the schedule and demands place on me were too hard. I'm hoping that coding and web development will still quench my hunger for creativity, problem solving, and serving people, but that it will be a little more flexable! My goal in taking on this new endeavor is to grow in my understanding of technology as well as find a career with great potential and longevity!
